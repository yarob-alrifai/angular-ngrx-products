# Angular NgRx Products

This project is a demonstration of using NgRx to manage product-related actions such as adding, editing, updating, and deleting products. It includes a frontend built with Angular, Angular Material, Tailwind CSS, and NgRx, and a backend powered by JSON Server.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Administrators can add, edit, update, and delete products.
- **Dynamic Display**: Products are displayed dynamically based on their categories.
- **Shared Components**: Shared components such as buttons, dialogs, and pipes are included for consistent UI elements across the application.
- **Angular Material**: Angular Material is used for UI components such as buttons, dialogs, navbar, and tabs.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling to create a responsive and visually appealing UI.
- **NgRx**: NgRx is used for state management, including actions, effects, reducers, and selectors.
- **Faker**: Faker is used to generate dummy data for demonstration purposes.
